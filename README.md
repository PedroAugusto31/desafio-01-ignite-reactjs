# Desafio 01 - Conceitos do React

This is the first challenge of Rockeseat's programming course: Ignite.

# The challenge

This challenge consisted only in doing some functions work, the project is
a to-do list, so I had to make the itens of the list to be checked, to delete
them and to add them as well.

I'm willing to do some extra stuff on this challenge and in the others
to come.

# Final considerations

I'm so happy to get the opportunity of doing this course, I'm looking forward
to learn new things with Rocketseat's team. ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥ðŸš€ðŸš€
